# Handwriting Recognition AI Model
<br>
This project is based on Neural Network where it recognizes the handwritten characters and gives the output in textual format.
<br>
The given input can be a dataset of handwritten characters (or digits).
<br>
These characters (or digits) are represented in 25x25 pixels i.e., in 2D pixelated format.<br>
Each line is represented in form of an array were each element represents a RGB value.<br>
User can select any input number from the test dataset which randomly generates a digit(or character).<br>
The characters/digits are coloured i.e., have different RGB values.<br>
Then the AI model will recognize te digit(or character) and matches it with the trained dataset to give an output.<br>
The given output will be the textual representation of these inputs.
